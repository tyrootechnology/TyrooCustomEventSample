# Tyroo Custom Event Sample

A sample project demonstrating how Tyroo ad network can plug into AdMob Mediation. The project contains a “Tyroo Vid.AI” SDK library as gradle dependency, as well as a sample custom event implementation for AdMob Mediation capable of loading interstitials and native ads.  A test application is also included, and uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK to call into custom event to test their implementations. It can be used during development to test new custom events, once ad units have been set up.
